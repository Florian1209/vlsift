cyvlfeat
========
A Python (cython) wrapper and library Vlfeat

We respect the original BSD 2-clause license and thus release this wrapper under the same license.

We thank the authors of VLFeat for their contribution to the computer vision community.


Development
-----------
requirements:

  - cython >=0.22
  - numpy >= 1.9
  - vlfeat >= 0.9.20

To make this easier, we suggest you use [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html). This makes installing the dependencies much simpler.
